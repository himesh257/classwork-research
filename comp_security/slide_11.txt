mac: media access control
lan: local area network
udp: user datagram protocol
tcp: transmission control protocol
icmp: internet control message protocol
tld: top level domain
ttl: time to live
DNSSEC: Domain Name System Security Extensions 
dos: disk operating system
ipsec: ip security
tls: transport layer security

Layers:
A: application
T: Transport
N: Network
L: Link

mac address is at network access layer
ip is at network layer
ip+port is at transport layer
domain names at app layer

translation between ip and mac addresses:
arp: address resolution protocol -- ipv4
ndp: neighbor discovery protocol -- ipv6

routing with ip address:
bgp: border gateway protocol -- long lived connection

translation between ip and domain name:
dns: domain name system

arp spoofing: arp is not authenticated
packet sniffing: network packets passed by untrusted hosts
tcp spoofing: tcp state can be easy to guess
dos attacks: open access
dns poisoning attacks: dns is not authenticated

arpwatch: sending messages or email when updates occur

udp: no acknowledgement, no flow control, no message continuation
tcp: connection oriented, preserves order
tcp seq numbers are 32 bits, acknowledgement number also 32 bits
If the SYN flag is set, then this is the initial sequence number. The sequence number of the actual first data byte is this sequence number plus 1. If the SYN flag is clear, then this is the accumulated sequence number of the first data byte of this packet for the current session.
If the ACK flag is set then this the next sequence number that the receiver is expecting. This acknowledges receipt of all prior bytes (if any). 

probability of guessing the ack number is 1/2^32

pharming: redireciting a websitrs traffic to some other fake website

dns cache poisoning: is the act of entering false information into a DNS cache, so that DNS queries return an incorrect response and users are directed to the wrong websites. DNS cache poisoning is also known as 'DNS spoofing.'
