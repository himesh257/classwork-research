for each number in our list:
    if we haven't seen it before:
        add it to our dictionary as a key,val pair
        where the key is the number
        and the value is the index
    if we have seen it before:
        we get the last seen index
        we compute the distance as:
            the current index - the last seen index (from the dict)
            if this is less than our best we update
        we always update our dict with the new index

    return our best
