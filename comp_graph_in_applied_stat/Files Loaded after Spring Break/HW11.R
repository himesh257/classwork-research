Use Ex_Cross_Validation.R to perform a 10-fold cross validation to choose between the model 
that includes weight and abdom with the model that includes weight, abdom, and thigh.Choose the 
model by RMSE, by Rsquared, and by MAE criteria. Are the choices consistent?Â Submit the output (no graphics needed) 
and a short paragraph into Canvas summarizing the results.
