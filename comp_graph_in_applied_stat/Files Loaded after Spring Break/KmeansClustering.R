#How many clusters does this method suggest?
#Why does this method work? Whatâ€™s the intuition behind it?
#Look at the code for wssplot() and figure out how it works

#plot suggests the use of 3 clusters

#another choice for number of clusters is to use the NbClust library which runs
# many experiments and gives a distribution of potential number of clusters

library(NbClust)
#NbClust package provides 26 (documentation says 30) indices for determining the number of clusters and proposes
# to user the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying
# all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods
