Given - Three arrays

P - Power for n spaceships

D - Defensive power for m bases

G - Gold at each base - again for m bases

We will solve this problem using binary search.

First use merge sort to sort the bases array. Complexity - O(m*log m)

Then, For each space ship in the p array, Use binary search to find the first element in bases array d which is greater or equal to the power for that spaceship.

Why we find the first element x greater than or equal to P[i], is because for all the other elements before x will have value strictly lesser than P[i], since our array is sorted.
