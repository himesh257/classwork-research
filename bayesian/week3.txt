posterior tells us everything about a parameter but to summarize it,
1) measure of location:
	mean, median, mod
2) measure of spread:
	sd, IQR
3) both location and spread:
	credible interval

- 95% credible interval means that there is a 95% probability that the parameter is inside the 95% credible interval
- 90% credible interval are more stable than 95% (unlike confidence interval)
- HDI: higher density interval
- points below the HDI the density is gonna be above w and outside HDI will have density below w
- meaning, every point that is inside the HDI will have the higher density than all others that are outside the interval
- unstandardized posterior doesnt add up to 1

Bayes' box:
theta: probability of heads
HH: probability of two heads
P(theta | HH) = P(HH | theta) * p(theta) / P(HH)

Metropolis algo (Markov chain monte carlo):
	Analytic methods: beta prior and burnolliy distrubution
	quadratic methods are inaccurate bc away from mode
	grid methods: Bayes box

idea: for some point theta, we propse a new point theta(star) at random, and we can either accept or reject, if accept then that will be the new theta and will look for another theta(star)
we look at the ratio of density of theta(star) and theta which will help in determining the next points
	r = prob(theta(star) | data) / prob(theta | data)
	
if density of theta(star) is gretaer than theta then we accept because r >= 1, otherwise we might or might not jump
