- posterior basically tells us everything we know NOW
- pd: between 50 to 100%, either strictly pos or strictly neg
- pd: prob of direction, basically it checks what is the prob of theta or some parameter to be on the same side as median
- it basically tells where you are from zero but doesnt say how far you are, use ROPE for that
- to decide wht the parameter is we use HDI + ROPE method
	1) if HDI is completely outside of ROPE interval then reject the idea of parameter being zero
	2) if HDI is completely inside of ROPE then accept the idea of parameter being zero
	3) else you are undecided
- common way of determining ROPE: (-0.1 * sd, 0.1 * sd), sd is standard dev of the outcome var
