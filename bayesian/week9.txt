Bayes factors: comparing prob of different model on same data
so now bayes rule = 
  prob(model | data) = prob(data | model)prob(model) / prob(data)

bayes factor(M1, M2) = prob(data | M2) / prob(data | M1)

- MSE usually used for regression, smaller is better, mainly for normal model
- use log score or log likliehood instead of MSE
- log functions always go up
- big value of log likliehood means better model
- adding elpd for each observaation gives elppd
