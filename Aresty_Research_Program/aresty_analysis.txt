poisson, binomial, random normal, and negative binomial distribution:
	-- The Poisson distribution is commonly used to model the number of expected events for a process given we know the average rate at which events occur during a given unit of time
		-- x = sum of time per person
		-- y = sum of x for everyone
		-- poisson distribution of y vs. (everyones answers)

plots:
-- choice vs right choice
	-- per question
	-- look at individual users
-- time it took to answer a question vs if they chose right answer
	-- to see if time affects their decision
-- histogram and boxplots: see how the answers and ideal choice can be conmpared. This will also help us detrminig outliers

imp commads:
-- summary
-- describe
-- table

Regression: (assumptions)
-- always plot the data before doing regression
-- we will regress upon the optimal choice vs the one that has been chosen
	-- per question
	-- look at individual users (and maybe draw some conclusion by taking variables like time in account)
	
-- different comparison models:
	# mod <- lm(optimalChoiceXa ~ Xa)
	# abline(mod) 
	# summary(mod)
		# regression line is basically the fitted value, which is predicted values mean of y given x
		# error: observed y value vs predicted y value
		# residual error --> summary(mod) command
		# also look at lpsa and lcavol
	
	1. Residual(errors) vs Fitted:
		-- linearity of the modal
		-- shows if residuals have non-linear patterns
	2. Norma Q-Q plot (Normal Quantile-Quantile plot): 
		-- shows if residuals are normally distributed
	3. Scale-Location:
		-- shows if residuals are spread equally along the ranges of predictors
	4. Residuals vs Leverage:
		-- helps us to find influential cases (robust regression can also help)

Other modals:
-- sampling
-- bootstrapping and CI from bootstrapping
-- monte carlo simulations
-- hypothesis testing (idk how), we will have to come up with some null and alternative hypothesis
-- Chi-Square goodness of fit test: is a non-parametric test that is used to find out how the observed value of a given phenomena is significantly different 	from the expected value
-- The Chi Square statistic: is commonly used for testing relationships between categorical variables
-- Fisher's exact test is a statistical test used to determine if there are nonrandom associations between two categorical variables.

NOTES:
-- linear prob modal
-- cross sectional time series linear regression
-- probit and logit
-- P(B) vs horizon
-- how dollar amount in each question affects the decision
-- think of different options where either of the choices should be chosen --> choice vs diff between cumB and cumA
		
Website: 
-- could design a webiste (maybe by using shiny) to display all the analysis
-- make it interactive so any other rexperiment with required parameters can have all the analysis done by programming (must have same looking excel sheet)
